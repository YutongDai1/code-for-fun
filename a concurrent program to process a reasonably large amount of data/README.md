edit configurations -> from Main pass CLI 1 arguments 
for example "100" the first arg is the threshold.

for now we use the small test csv file for convenience.You can replace them with original file.

for the Concurrent solution you can do the change like this screenshot. First set the name with the name of csv file that you want to change and add the file to resources/csv.
